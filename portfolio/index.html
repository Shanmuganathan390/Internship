        <h3>1.Traffic light Simulation</h3><br>
        <p >Traffic light simulation models real-world intersections using timed signals. Red stops vehicles, yellow warns to slow down, and green allows movement. Simulations help learners understand control logic, reduce congestion, test safety rules, and practice programming with states, timers, and event-based transitions in a virtual environment for educational and practical purposes.</p><br>
        <h3>2.AI battery Management</h3><br>
        <p>AI-based Battery Management Systems (BMS) use machine learning to monitor battery health, predict remaining life, optimize charging and discharging, and improve safety. They reduce energy waste, prevent overheating, extend battery lifespan, and enhance performance in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and smart devices.</p></br>
